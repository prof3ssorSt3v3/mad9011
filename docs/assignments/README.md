# MAD9014 Deliverables

## GitHub

Many of your assignments will be submitted as a link in BSLMS to a GitHub Repo.

[Here is a general guide on getting started with Repos](./github.md)

## Quizzes

Worth <Badge type="error" text="20%"/> of Final Grade

Most classes, starting in week 2, will have a few questions asked during the first 10 minutes. The questions will be based on the readings, lessons, and videos from the previous week.

The questions will be asked outloud. First person to raise their hand gets the chance to answer correctly.

For each correct answer you earn 5%. Four correct answers give you the full 20% for the quiz part of your final grade.

A partially correct answer gets you no marks. However, it does give someone else the chance to steal the marks with part of the question answered.

## Hybrids

Worth <Badge type="error" text="25%"/> of Final Grade

Every week there will be exercises for you to complete on your own outside of class. The time for these exercises is roughly equivalent to 14 hours in total, one hour per week. Some exercises will be larger than others. Some will be completed quickly and others will take longer. All together, the hybrid exercises are worth 25% of your final grade. They are all due on Thursday evenings.

## Exercises

Worth <Badge type="error" text="20%"/> of Final Grade

These exercises will be largely completed in class. However, you will be given time to finish the exercises at home, after class. Remember to read the tutorials and watch the videos as the best way to be prepared for these exercises. Together these exercises are worth 20% of your final grade.
