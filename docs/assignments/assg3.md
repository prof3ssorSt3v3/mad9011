# Assignment 03  

## User Interface Visual Prototype

It's time for the finale!

The final assignment for this semester is to create an Android app experience.

Putting our Illustrator, Photoshop, SVG, and Xd prototype skills to test to complete an app launching experiece. (Design in mind that these graphics will be presented in Web front-end coding: html, css, and svg.)

**Usage scenario:** A user takes out their Android phone, tap on the "Launcher" icon to start the application, while loading, the animated loading icon is spinning on top of the Application splash screen.

## App Requirements

1. `svg` loader icon (only visual not functional) – Animated SVG [tools: Illustrator > Code editor]

Example: [samherbert.net/svg-loaders/](http://samherbert.net/svg-loaders/)

2. 5 launcher `.png` icons for Android [tool: Illustrator]: **48px × 48px** (mdpi), 72 × 72 px (hdpi), 96 × 96 px (xhdpi), 144 × 144 px (xxhdpi), 192 × 192 px (xxxhdpi) 

Size reference: [iconhandbook.co.uk/reference/chart/android/](http://iconhandbook.co.uk/reference/chart/android/)

**Note:** Create one icon (48x48) and output all 5 PNG icons in various dimensions. 

3. landscape and portrait `.png `splash screens all sizes(10) [tool: Photoshop]:

    - Portrait: 320x480px
    - Landscape: 480x320px
- HDPI:
    - Portrait: 480x800px
    - Landscape: 800x480px
- XHDPI:

    - Portrait: 1280px1920px
    - Landscape: 1920x1280px

4. UI prototype URLs [tool: Xd]: 
**Note:** Follow the usage scenario above to layout your screens. Add interactivity and create a sharable link for submission: Share for Development


## Submission

::: warning

**Due Friday December 18 by 5pm**

This is the last possible day to submit **ANY** work.

:::

There are THREE things you need to do to submit this assignment.

1. A demo of the app must be shown running on one of the lab devices. It needs to have the launcher icons and splashscreen images, your Algonquin username must be the displayed App Name on the device, and the app needs to be in a usable state. _There can be minor errors in the functionality during the demo._ If you submit a repo without doing the demo of your app in class this means an automatic 30% deduction in the project grade. Steve will be in class Tuesday Dec. 10th 8am - 1pm and Friday Dec. 13th 8am - 12pm for people to do their demos.

2. A Private GitHub Repo called **cordova-movie** needs to be created and invite your instructor through the Settings page. There is NO need to activate github-pages for this project.

3. Submit the URL for your repo to the Brightspace Assignments page for Project 2.
