# Exercise 1 - Functions

## Details

The purpose of this exercise is to practice writing a function that can be used repeatedly, work with Random Numbers and concatenate Strings.

Take a copy of this [Starter file zip version](/mad9014/ex1-starter.txt.zip) and rename it as `function-ex.js`. [Starter file txt version](/mad9014/ex1-starter.txt).

Your JavaScript file must have a multi-line comment block at the top of the page with a description, plus your full name, Algonquin username, and date the file was last saved.

Follow the instructions inside the starter file. Edit the array values, create the second and third functions.

Use the terminal in VSCode and the `node` command to test your script.

```
node function-ex.js
```
