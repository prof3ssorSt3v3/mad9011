::: danger jQUERY and WINDOWS

DO NOT USE BOOTSTRAP or JQUERY on this project

YOU MUST DEVELOP THIS APP ON WINDOWS

:::

The final project for this semester is to create an Android app using Cordova. The app will be a Cordova version of the Movie Web App that we built for Project 1.

## App Requirements

This app will be a fully working version of [Project 1](./proj1.md) turned into a Cordova App with launcher icons and splashscreen images.

1. All the features from the **Project 1 Movie Web App** must work in the Cordova App.
2. The app name on the device should be your Algonquin Username.
3. The app needs to have a splashscreen shown for at least 5 seconds when the app loads. The splashscreen image must be a unique image created by you. There needs to be a set of portrait and landscape versions of the splashscreen for different screen resolutions.
4. The app needs to have a set of .png launcher icons designed for different screen resolutions. The icons must be unique images created by you, NOT images downloaded from some online source.

## Submission

::: warning

**Due Friday December 13 by 1pm**

This is the last possible day to submit **ANY** work.

:::

There are THREE things you need to do to submit this assignment.

1. A demo of the app must be shown running on one of the lab devices. It needs to have the launcher icons and splashscreen images, your Algonquin username must be the displayed App Name on the device, and the app needs to be in a usable state. _There can be minor errors in the functionality during the demo._ If you submit a repo without doing the demo of your app in class this means an automatic 30% deduction in the project grade. Steve will be in class Tuesday Dec. 10th 8am - 1pm and Friday Dec. 13th 8am - 12pm for people to do their demos.

2. A Private GitHub Repo called **cordova-movie** needs to be created and invite your instructor through the Settings page. There is NO need to activate github-pages for this project.

3. Submit the URL for your repo to the Brightspace Assignments page for Project 2.
