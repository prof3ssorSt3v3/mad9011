<badge type="error" text="Prepare starter file" />

## Introduction

Welcome to the final assignment of the Illustrator portion of this course. This project offers you an exciting opportunity to showcase the skills you have acquired so far by creating a set of innovative and visually captivating App Icons for an imaginary app of your own invention.

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will design three versions of the same app icon, each optimized for different devices:

- iPhone – 57x57 px, corner radius 10 px

  - **Design:** Create a minimalist black and white icon with a focus on simplicity and clarity.
  - **Theme:** Represent the core concept and functionality of your app.

- iPad – 144x144 px, corner radius 24 px

  - **Design:** Craft a vibrant, full-color icon with medium detail to captivate the audience's attention.
  - **Theme:** Showcase the unique identity and branding of your app.

- iTunes – 512x512 px, corner radius 90 px

  - **Design:** Create a high-fidelity icon with intricate details to convey the full potential of your app.
  - **Theme:** Display the app's features and sophistication in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

Ensure that all three versions share a cohesive design language, forming a unified set of app icons.

## Guidelines:

1. Each app icon should be thoughtfully crafted on its own layer and artboard with proper naming, as shown in the example below:

- Artboard: iPhone_57x57
- Artboard: iPad_144x144
- Artboard: iTunes_512x512

2. Include the name of your app on each icon to provide context and reference.

3. Utilize the appropriate tools, such as shapes and the pen tool, to bring your icon designs to life.

4. Master the use of colors and gradients, adhering to a well-defined color palette that aligns with your app's theme.

5. Your icon designs should strike the right balance between showcasing your skills and maintaining simplicity that aligns with the app's purpose.
