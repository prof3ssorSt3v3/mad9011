## Guidelines

In this assignment, you will design three versions of the same app icon, each optimized for different devices:

- **iPhone – 57x57 px, corner radius 10 px**

  - **Design:** Create a minimalist black and white icon with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

- **iPad – 144x144 px, corner radius 24 px**

  - **Design:** Craft a vibrant, full-color icon with medium detail to captivate the audience's attention.

- **iTunes – 512x512 px, corner radius 90 px**

  - **Design:** Create a high-fidelity icon with intricate details to convey the full potential of your app.

Ensure that all three versions share a cohesive design language, forming a unified set of app icons.

## Instructions

1. **Begin by Crafting Your Illustrator File:**

   - Create a new Illustrator file, and thoughtfully name it as lName-fName-Midterm-AppIcon.

2. **Artboard and Layer Creation:**

   - Within your Illustrator file, establish three artboards following the provided guidelines. Create dedicated layers for each artboard, ensuring a clear organization. Remember to name your artboards and layers as follows:
     - Artboard/Layer: iPhone_57x57
     - Artboard/Layer: iPad_144x144
     - Artboard/Layer: iTunes_512x512

3. **Artboard Background Setup:**

   - Set up the background for each icon with the appropriate corner radii as specified.

4. **Bringing Your Icons to Life:**

   - Utilize the range of tools available, including shapes and the precise pen tool, to breathe life into your icon designs.

5. **Colors and Gradients Mastery:**

   - Exhibit mastery in the use of colors and gradients. Adhere to a carefully chosen color palette that harmonizes with your app's theme.

6. **Balancing Skill and Purpose:**

   - Strive for a harmonious blend between showcasing your design prowess and maintaining the essence of simplicity aligned with the app's intended purpose.

7. **Originality and Reference:**

   - Important: Refrain from incorporating elements traced from others' work. If you require reference, consider using a photograph of the real subject, as noted. This ensures the authenticity and originality of your creations.
