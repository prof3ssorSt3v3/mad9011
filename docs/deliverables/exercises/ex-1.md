# Exercise 1 — Select & Mask: Non-Destructive Image Editing and Composition

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll get hands-on with masking techniques. Begin by selecting an image and removing its original background using tools like Quick Selection, Refine Edge, and Select & Mask. Keep your workflow non-destructive by using layers and adjustment layers.

Once you've mastered background replacement, take it a step further. Create a visually captivating composition by blending multiple images together. Your goal is to craft a harmonious scene that tells a compelling story.

## Instructions

1. **Select and Mask:**

   - Choose a primary subject image. Use Photoshop's masking tools to remove the original background.
   - Find a new background image from free stock sites like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com). Ensure the stock image is watermark-free.

2. **Create a Composite Image:**

   - Combine the masked subject with the new background in a single Photoshop document.
   - Integrate an additional two images into your composition, ensuring they complement the overall theme and aesthetic.
   - Use layer adjustments to ensure all elements in the composition blend naturally, paying attention to color balance, lighting, and overall tone.

3. **Exporting Your Work:**
   - Export the final composition using the 'Export As...' dialogue. Save the image in an 'Exports' folder as a PNG at 1000px wide.
