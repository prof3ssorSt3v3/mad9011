# Exercise 1 — Select & Mask: Non-Destructive Image Editing and Composition

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll get hands-on with masking techniques. Begin by selecting an image and removing its original background using tools like Quick Selection, Refine Edge, and Select & Mask. Keep your workflow non-destructive by using layers and adjustment layers.

Once you've mastered background replacement, take it a step further. Create a visually captivating composition by blending multiple images together. Your goal is to craft a harmonious scene that tells a compelling story.

Let's get started on this journey of creative editing and composition!

## Instructions

1. Choose an image that you would like to work with for this exercise. Make sure it has a distinct subject that you can mask and place in a new background.

2. Open the image in Photoshop.
3. **Selection and Masking:**

   - Use the Quick Selection Tool to select your subject.
   - Refine the selection's edges using tools like the Refine Edge or Select & Mask tools.

4. **Non-Destructive Editing:**

   - Create a mask to separate your subject from the background.
   - Improve the subject's appearance using adjustment layers like Brightness/Contrast or Color Balance.

5. **Background Replacement:**

   - Find a new background image that matches your subject.
   - Place this background below your subject layer.
   - Adjust sizes and positions to make the subject fit naturally.
   - Blend subject and background by considering lighting and color.

6. **Composition and Image Blending:**

   - Add a minimum of **2** additional images that work with your subject and background.
   - Select and place elements from these images into your composition.
   - Arrange, scale, and rotate to create a pleasing composition.
   - Adjust lighting and color for consistency.

7. **File Organization:**

   - Keep your Photoshop project organized by using well-labeled layers, adjustment layers, and groups for different elements.
   - Ensure your layers are logically organized in the Layers panel for easier navigation and editing.

8. **Exporting:**

   - Once you are satisfied with your composition, save your work and then export it as a PNG file with a width of 1000 pixels.
   - Create a folder named lName-fName-select-and-mask and include your Photoshop file and the exported PNG file in an "Exports" subfolder. Include the original images within your "Links" subfolder
