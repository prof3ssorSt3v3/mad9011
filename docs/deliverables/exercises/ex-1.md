# Exercise 1 — Select & Mask

## Instructions

Select an image and use the masking techniques learned in class to remove the original background of an image. Once the original background is removed find a new image and place it as the new background. You can find free stock images for the background at [Unsplash](https:://unsplash.com), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), or another stock image site (just make sure your stock image does not have a watermark on it). Once you have completed masking your subject and replacing the background, export your image using the Export As... dialogue into an Exports folder.

## Example

## File Set Up

Your Photoshop file should be named fName-lName-section#-select-and-mask.psd. The size of your artboard will be dependent on your original subject image. Your file should have a layer named "Subject" containing your foreground image that is masked and a layer named "Background" featuring your new background image.
