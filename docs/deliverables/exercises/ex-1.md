# Exercise 1 — Select & Mask: Non-Destructive Image Editing and Composition

## Instructions

Select an image and use the masking techniques learned in class to remove the original background of the image. Utilize tools such as Quick Selection, Refine Edge, or Select & Mask to achieve precise selections. Ensure a non-destructive workflow by using layers and adjustment layers for editing.

Once you have completed masking your subject and replacing the background, take it a step further and create a visually appealing composition. Incorporate more than one image to blend elements together and form a cohesive composition.

## Background Replacement Tips

To seamlessly integrate the subject into the new background, consider the following tips:

- Adjust the lighting and color of the subject to match the new environment.
- Use layer blending modes and opacity adjustments to create a natural blend.
- Pay attention to shadows and reflections for a realistic look.

## Sample Images

You can find a set of sample images to work with here: [Sample Images](). Feel free to use these images to get started.

## Creating a Composition

In addition to replacing the background, challenge yourself to create a compelling composition by blending multiple images together. Use a minimum of four images in total, with one being the background image. Select and mask subjects from different images and combine them creatively to achieve a visually balanced composition.

## Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues and solutions you might encounter during the exercise:

- If the edges of the selection are rough, use the Refine Edge tool to smooth them out.
- If the subject looks disconnected from the new background, adjust the color balance and lighting.

## Be Creative!

Don't limit yourself to just stock images. Consider creating your backgrounds and incorporating various elements to compose a unique and visually stunning image.
