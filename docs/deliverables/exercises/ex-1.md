# Exercise 1 — UI Banners

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use selection tools and layer masks to create a set of banners for a mock product launch, organized across multiple artboards. By the end of this exercise, you'll have designed three different banner sizes while practicing masking and compositing skills in Photoshop.

## Exercise Steps:

1. **Set Up Artboards:**

   - Create a new document in Photoshop and set up 3 artboards of standard advertising banner sizes:
     - **Size 1**: 300x250px
     - **Size 2**: 300x600px
     - **Size 3**: 900x300px
   - Name each artboard appropriately for easy organization.

2. **Choose a theme:**

   Select one of the following advertising themes:

   - **Pet Store:** Promote pet products like food, toys, or grooming services.
   - **Tech Gadget:** Advertise a new smartphone, laptop, or tech device.
   - **Fashion Sale:** Create banners for a seasonal clothing sale or new collection.
   - **Fitness & Wellness:** Promote a gym, fitness class, or health product.
   - **Travel:** Advertise a vacation package or travel service.
   - **Food Delivery:** Showcase a food delivery app or restaurant special.
   - **Eco-Friendly Products:** Promote sustainable, environmentally friendly products.
   - **Beauty & Skincare:** Advertise beauty or skincare products.

3. **Selecting Images:**

   - Find and import images related to your chosen theme (e.g., product photos, backgrounds, or textures).
   - You need to include at least 3 images.
   - Use the Quick Selection Tool or Magic Wand to isolate specific elements, such as the product or model in the image.
   - Practice refining your selection using the "Select and Mask" workspace to get precise edges.

4. **Masking:**

   - Once you've selected the object, apply a layer mask to hide the original background.
   - Use Refine Edge and feathering to smooth out any rough edges, especially around areas like hair or fine details.

5. **Design Layout:**

   - Use the artboards to create a consistent design for all banners, with the product or subject in focus.
   - Use smart objects and adjustment layers to maintain non-destructive editing.

   > Think about where text or other design elements might be placed in your design and adjust the layout to accommodate them. It is not required to add text or other design elements beyond what is being asked.

6. **Final Touches:**

   - Use adjustment layers (e.g., brightness/contrast, hue/saturation) to enhance the overall look.
   - Make sure the composition is balanced, and that the subject blends well with the background.
   - Double-check that all banners follow the same design theme with appropriate spacing and alignment.

- [Select & Mask](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/masking.html)

## Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues and solutions you might encounter during the exercise:

- If the edges of the selection are rough, use the Refine Edge tool to smooth them out.
- If the subject looks disconnected from the new background, adjust the color balance and lighting.
- For better integration, ensure the lighting direction in all images matches.

## File Setup and Submission

Compress and submit your `lName-fName-section#-ui-banner` folder containing:

- `lName-fName-section#-ui-banner.psd` (Photoshop file with organized layers).
- 'Originals' folder with original images used.
- 'Exports' folder with the final images:
  - `ui-banner-300x250.png`
