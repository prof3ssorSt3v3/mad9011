## Introduction

In this exercise, you will practice photo retouching techniques using Adobe Photoshop. You'll work on four images, learning how to remove blemishes, use content-aware fill, get rid of watermarks, and restore damaged photos. The focus is on using non-destructive editing methods to keep the original images intact while making your edits look natural and professional. By the end, you’ll be able to enhance and clean up images with convincing results.

## Instructions

Apply the retouching techniques practiced in class to the items below.

### File 1: 01-photoshop-repairing-blemishes

- Remove all blemishes on the model in the photo
- Use the tools explored in class to make all edits **non-destructive**.

### File 2: 02-photoshop-content-aware-fill

- Use content aware fill to remove the random giraffe **non-destructively**.
- Make sure the grass texture looks good and convincing!

### File 3: 03-photoshop-watermark-removal

- Remove all the watermarks from the image
- Use the tools explored in class to make all edits **non-destructive**.

### File 4: 04-photoshop-photo-restoration

- Restore the image by removing the cracks and watermarks in the image **non-destructively**.
- Make any other adjustments you want to improve the image.
