## Introduction

In this exercise, you’ll learn how basic shapes can be the building blocks of professional logo design. Recreating these logos will help you understand how to deconstruct complex designs into simpler forms. You will apply shape tools, the Pathfinder panel, and anchor point manipulation to refine your logos and achieve clean, polished results. This process mirrors what professional designers do when creating logos from scratch or updating existing designs.

## Instructions

1. Download and open the provided Illustrator file for this exercise from above.

2. Navigate to the "Final Artwork" layer in the Illustrator file, where you'll find the corresponding labeled artboards for each logo.

3. Begin by using simple shapes (rectangles, ellipses, polygons, etc.) to create the basic structure of the logos. Use Illustrator’s **Shape Builder Tool** and **Pathfinder Tools** to combine or subtract shapes as needed.

4. Fine-tune your design by manipulating anchor points using the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** for more precise control over curves and angles.

5. Pay attention to details: proportions, smoothness of curves, and alignment. Use **Smart Guides** (`Ctrl/Cmd + U`) for precision in aligning and snapping elements.

6. Ensure you match the colors of the provided logos by using the **Eyedropper Tool (I)** to sample colors.

7. Review and finalize your work for clean lines, smooth curves, and accurate proportions, ensuring a polished and professional result.

## File Setup

Save your Illustrator file as `lName-fName-logo-recreation.ai`. Ensure your file is organized with layers labeled clearly, and all logos are recreated on the "Final Artwork" layer. You do not need to export JPG versions.
