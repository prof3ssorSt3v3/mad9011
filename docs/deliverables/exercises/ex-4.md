# Exercise 4 - Gradients in Nature

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will showcase your proficiency in creating and manipulating gradients in Adobe Illustrator. You will work on a poster design, applying various gradient techniques to achieve visual depth, dimension, and creativity.

## Instructions

1. **Research:** Start by researching various natural landscapes such as mountains, forests, oceans, or sunsets. Gather reference images to inspire your poster design.

2. **Document Setup:** Create a new Adobe Illustrator document with the dimensions of 18 inches (width) by 24 inches (height). Set the color mode to CMYK and the resolution to 300 DPI.

3. **Background Gradient:** Choose a scenic landscape as your background and use gradients to create a smooth transition of colors. Experiment with radial or linear gradients to emulate the natural lighting and atmospheric effects of the chosen scene.

4. **Foreground Elements:** Add various natural elements to the poster, such as mountains, trees, water, or clouds. Apply gradients to these elements to give them a realistic and three-dimensional appearance.

5. **Color Harmony:** Pay attention to color harmony and choose a complementary color palette that enhances the mood and atmosphere of the poster. Use the Color Guide or Color Themes panel in Illustrator to help with color selection.

6. **Transparency and Blending Modes:** Utilize transparency and blending modes to create subtle overlays or soft transitions between gradients, adding depth and complexity to the design.

7. **Refining Details:** Pay attention to details, ensuring smooth transitions and well-defined shapes. Refine the placement and size of each element to create a balanced and visually appealing composition.
