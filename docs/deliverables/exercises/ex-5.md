# Exercise 5 — Creating Icons

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will be tasked with creating a set of user interface (UI) icons using Adobe Illustrator. This activity is designed to help you understand the basics of icon design, including consistency, simplicity, and scalability. You will apply design principles and Illustrator techniques to create icons that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally clear.

## Instructions

1. Download and open the provided Illustrator file for this exercise from Brightspace. The file will be posted on Brightspace before your lab class. This file contains a template set up with predefined artboards and grid systems to help you get started.

2. Start by created your icons within the 24x24 px artboard. Each artboard is labeled with the icon you are to create.

3. Once you have created your 24x24 px icons, scale them to 48x48 px. ensure that your font weights and corner radii scale accordingly. You may accomplish this by;

- Outlining your strokes and uniting your layers into a single shape.
- Manually adjusting your weights and radii

4. Finishing steps:

- Organize your layers by grouping and labeling.
- Make sure you save your .ai file.
- Be sure to hide the **keyline** layers before exporting
- Export your artboards using `export for Screens` dialogue.

## Tips

- **Designing Your Icons**: Use the tools and techniques discussed in class to create your icons. Make sure to:

  - Stick to the grid and guidelines provided in the Illustrator file.
  - Apply consistent styles (e.g., line width, corner radius) across all icons for uniformity.
  - Design for scalability. Your icons should be easily recognizable at various sizes.

- **Refinement and Review**: Once your icons are designed, take a step back and review them as a set. Look for inconsistencies, and make sure each icon communicates its intended function clearly. Adjust as necessary.
