# Exercise 6 — Animated SVG

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll create an animated SVG loader to enhance user experience during application loading times. This task combines design skills with basic web development to implement a visually appealing and functional loader.

## Instructions

To successfully complete this exercise, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain the Illustrator File:**

- Access Brightspace to download the provided Illustrator file specifically for this exercise. The file will be available before your scheduled lab class.

2. **Design Your Loader:**

- Utilize Adobe Illustrator to design your loader. Pay attention to optimizing your layers for web export during this process.

3. **Export and Prepare the SVG:**

Export your loader design as SVG using the 'Export as...' option in Illustrator. Make sure your file is properly optimized for web use.

4. **Integrate the SVG into HTML:**

- Embed the SVG code directly into the index.html file of your project. This step involves copying the exported SVG code into the HTML file.

5. **Refine the SVG Code:**

- Clean up the SVG code by removing any unnecessary xml tags. Also, ensure that all styles are externalized to a CSS file rather than being inline within the SVG code.

6. **Create a Multi-Step CSS Animation:**

- Craft a CSS animation that unfolds across multiple stages to add dynamic visual interest. Aim to design an animation sequence that integrates several keyframes, creating a compelling and engaging motion effect.

## Example

Your task is to create a loader similar to the one shown below:
