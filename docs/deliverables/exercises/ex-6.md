## Instructions

For this exercise, you'll be creating an application loader using an animated SVG. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment:

1. Designing the Loader:

   - Use Adobe Illustrator to create an engaging loader design. The loader should be visually appealing and aligned with the aesthetics of a loading animation.
   - Ensure that your Illustrator file is ready for export using the "Export as..." dialogue.
     - This includes setting up the layers, artboard size, and any other necessary details for a clean export.

2. SVG Code and Styling:

   - Copy the SVG code generated from your Illustrator design and paste it within the index.html file.
   - All styling for the SVG loader should be written in the main.css file located in the ./css directory.

3. Creating the Animation:
   - Inside the main.css file, develop the animation for the loader using CSS animations and transitions.
   - The animation should make the loader visually appealing and convey the sense of progress or activity.

## Example

Here's an example of what your finished loader could look like:
