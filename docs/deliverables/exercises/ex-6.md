  <Countdown :weekNumber="5">

Follow the steps below to complete the assignment:

1. **Designing the Loader:**

   - Use Adobe Illustrator to create an engaging loader design. The loader should be visually appealing and aligned with the aesthetics of a loading animation.
   - Ensure that your Illustrator file is ready for export using the "Export as..." dialogue.
     - This includes setting up the layers, artboard size, and any other necessary details for a clean export.

2. **SVG Code and Styling:**

   - Copy the SVG code generated from your Illustrator design and paste it within the index.html file.
   - All styling for the SVG loader should be written in the main.css file located in the ./css directory.

3. **Creating the Animation:**
   - Inside the main.css file, develop the animation for the loader using CSS animations and transitions.
   - The animation should make the loader visually appealing and convey the sense of progress or activity.

## Example

Here's an example of what your finished loader could look like:
