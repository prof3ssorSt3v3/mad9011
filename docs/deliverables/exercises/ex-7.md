# Exercise 7 — Interactive SVG

## Instructions

Create a welcome banner for a website that features animated SVG. Your banner must include the following:

- Text — a simple welcome message (The text can be SVG text or HTML overlaid on top of the banner)
- CSS Animation that loops infinitely
- An element that changes on a mouse hover that has a CSS Transition

Design your banner to work well on laptop screen sizes (~1300px wide) and larger. You are not required to make it responsive. Your SVG code should be written directly inside of the `index.html` file and the styling should all be written in the `./css/main.css` file.

- ./css
  - main.css
