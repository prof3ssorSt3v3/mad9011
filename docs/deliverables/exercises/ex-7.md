# Exercise 7 — Animated SVG

## Instructions

Create an application loader using an animated SVG. To complete this exercise you must:

- Create your loader in Illustrator and prep the file for export via the Export for Screens dialogue.
- Copy the SVG code into the index.html file.
- Create the animation in the main.css file.

Design your banner to work well on laptop screen sizes (~1300px wide) and larger. You are not required to make it responsive. Your SVG code should be written directly inside of the `index.html` file and the styling should all be written in the `./css/main.css` file.

## Example

- index.html
- Loader.ai
