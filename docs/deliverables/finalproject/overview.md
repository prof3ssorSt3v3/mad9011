# Final Project Briefing

## Project Overview

### Introduction

As we approach the culmination of our course, it's time to embark on a significant journeyâ€”the final project. This endeavor will see you working in teams of three to develop a mobile application using Figma. This project is not just another assignment; it represents a considerable portion of your grade, contributing to **40%** of your final assessment.

Over the next seven weeks, our curriculum will be strategically aligned with the various stages of your project development. This alignment ensures that the knowledge and skills you acquire will be directly applicable, enhancing your project's quality and relevance. The project's grading will be segmented into five distinct categories, each with its own set of deadlines.

### Project Components

The project will unfold in five phases:

- **Part 1:** Low-fidelity Wireframes
- **Part 2:** Design System
- **Part 3:** Visual Design
- **Part 4:** Visual Interactive Prototype
- **Part 5:** Presentations

### Theme Selection

Your application can explore one of the following themes:

1. Car Rental
