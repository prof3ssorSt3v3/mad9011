## Introduction

Welcome to the initial phase of your final project journey!

After forming your teams and selecting a theme for your application, the next step is to start the design process with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma.

### The Essence of Low-fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are the backbone of the design brainstorming process, akin to the simplicity and rapid creation you find with paper sketches. Their primary purpose is to outline the spatial arrangements of content and functional elements across your app's screens, intentionally omitting design details such as colors, images, or typography. This minimalist approach keeps the focus squarely on the layout and user flow.

For this project phase, we'll bypass traditional paper sketches and dive straight into digital wireframing with Figma.

**Key Guidelines:**

- Avoid incorporating:
  - Colors
  - Images
  - Detailed icons (use basic shapes as placeholders)
- Use placeholder text (e.g., lorem ipsum) for text-heavy sections.

### Designing Your Screens

- Each team must design a homepage.
- Additionally, every team member is responsible for creating two unique screens.

Thus, for a team of two, you'll be designing a total of five screens.

## Project Instructions

1. Share the Figma file with all team members and your professor to ensure collaborative access.
2. Choose the target device for your app's design.
3. Start designing your wireframes.
4. Establish the foundational layout of your app.
5. Organize your Figma canvas to clearly distinguish between each team member's contributions.
