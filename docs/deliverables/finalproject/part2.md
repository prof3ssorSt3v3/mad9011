## Introduction

In **Part 2** of this project, we aim to craft a concise design system for your application. A robust design system ensures consistency throughout your application and simplifies the visual design process as many elements are predefined.

## Requirements

For your design system, you must incorporate:

### Week 10

- **Typography**: Define your application's fonts, sizes, weights, and line heights.
- **Colours**: Establish a color palette, including primary, secondary, and accent colors.
- **Iconography**: Choose or design consistent icon components for common actions and indicators.

### Week 11

- **Buttons**: Design button styles, including hover, active, and disabled states.
- **Cards**: Structure card elements for content presentation.
- **Fields**: Design input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and other form components.
- **Navigation**: Create designs for menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, and other navigation elements.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Setup**: Create a new file within your project and name it "Part 2: Design System."
   ![Step 1](./assets/step-1.png)

2. **Categorization**: Establish separate pages for different components of your design system, such as:
   ![Step 2](./assets/step-2.png)

   - Colours
   - Typography
   - Buttons
   - Cards
   - Tabs
   - And more

3. **Typography**: Detail your typography choices, including size, font family, and weights.
   (This just an example, you **do not need** to recreate this exactly.)

4. **Color Palette**: Define your color selections, distinguishing between primary, secondary, and accent shades.
   (This just an example, **you do not need** to recreate this exactly.)
   ![Step 4](./assets/step-4.png)

5. **Component Identification**: Review your mid-fidelity wireframes to identify necessary components.

6. **Component Creation**: Develop your components on their respective pages, ensuring:

   - Components are appropriately named.
   - Variants for different states or versions are created.
     (This just an example, **you do not need** to recreate this exactly.)

7. **Global Styles**: After defining your colours and typography, formulate "global" styles for each. Proper naming conventions are essential.
   ![Step 7](./assets/styles.png)
   _Note_: The number of styles in the example might exceed what you'll have, as they are from a comprehensive Design System.

8. **Publishing**: After completing your Design System, publish your assets to your Team Library.

9. **Integration**: In your Wireframes file, enable access to your design system.

- [ ] Icons are understandable and align with the overall design language.

### Week 11 Components

- [ ] Button components have been created.
- [ ] Card components have been created.
- [ ] **Needed** input field components have been created.
- [ ] **Needed** navigation components have been created.

### Component Creation and Global Styles

- [ ] Variants for different states or versions of components are created.
- [ ] "Global" styles for colors and typography are formulated and named following proper conventions.

### Publishing and Integration

- [ ] The design system is published to the Team Library, making it accessible for use in other files.
- [ ] The wireframes file has access enabled to the design system for seamless integration.

### Submission and Documentation

- [ ] Figma project link is provided.
- [ ] The app's chosen theme is described.
- [ ] A list of all group members is included.

## Submission Process

Instead of a traditional file submission, share your work using Figma's sharing feature. In the submission comment section, kindly include:

- Figma project link.
- Your apps's chosen theme.
- List of all group members.

Since your professor was invited during Part 1, there's no need for another invitation.
