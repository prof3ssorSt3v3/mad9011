# Part 3: Visual Design

## Introduction

This week you will be creating a Visual Prototype of your application. To do this you will apply your design system to your wireframes along with any additional styling not in your design system.

## Instructions

1. In your wireframe file, create a new Page called "Part 3 - Visual Design."

2. If you find it helpful, copy your initial wireframes into this new page for reference.

3. Start applying styles from your design system.

4. Ensure that you use real photos and copy in your visual design.

## Things to Remember

- Use your design system / components
- Typography
- Colours
- Buttons
- You must create all components that are interactive.
  I.e. If you only designed one button component but your site will have multiple types, you must create components for them.
- Your visual design / visual prototype should look like a real website.
- You will not prototype your visual design this week.

## Submission Requirements

- Your generated Figma link
