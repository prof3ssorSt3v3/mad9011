# Part 4: Visual Design

## Introduction

This week, you're tasked with crafting a Visual Prototype of your application. This involves integrating your design system with your wireframes and incorporating any additional styling not covered in your design system.

## Instructions

1. Within your wireframe file, establish a new Page titled "Part 4 - Visual Design."

2. For clarity, you may opt to replicate your initial wireframes into this newly created page.

3. Begin the process of incorporating styles derived from your design system.

4. Ensure the inclusion of authentic photos and copy to make your visual design realistic.

## Key Points to Consider

- Utilize your design system and its components, which includes:
  - Typography
  - Colours
  - Buttons
  - etc
- All interactive components must be created. For instance, if your design featured a single button component, but the app necessitates multiple variants, ensure each variant has its respective component.
- Aim for your visual design to mirror the appearance of an actual app.
- Prototyping of your visual design isn't required for this week.
