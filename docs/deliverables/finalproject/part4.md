# Part 4: Interactive Visual Prototype

## Introduction

This week's focus is on creating an interactive prototype for your mobile application. This process involves adding triggers and actions to your visual design, transforming it into a dynamic, user-friendly prototype.

## Instructions

1. Initiate the task by establishing a new page titled "Part 5 - Interactive Prototype."
2. Migrate your visual design to this newly created page.
3. Begin the process of linking your screens together.

## Key Considerations

- Ensure all screens are interconnected via the "Tap" function, enabling fluid navigation between them.
- Integrate at least one additional Action/Trigger apart from "Tap."
- If necessary, design supplementary screens to seamlessly link your initial screens.
- Aim for your prototype to emulate the look and functionality of an authentic mobile app.
- Thoroughly assess your prototype using the **Preview mode**.

## Submission Procedure

Rather than a traditional file submission, utilize Figma's sharing feature to showcase your work. Within the comment section of your submission, ensure the inclusion of:

- The Figma project link.
- The chosen theme for your application.
- A list of all group members.

Given that your professor received an invitation during Part 1, a re-invitation is unnecessary.
