# Part 5: Presentations

## Introduction

This week culminates in the presentation of all the work you've completed from Parts 1 through 4 of the Final Project.

Each group is allotted a maximum of 5 minutes for their presentation. If your computer lacks an HDMI port, please remember to bring an appropriate adapter. I will provide a USBC -> HDMI adapter if needed.

## Presentation Requirements:

- **Display Your Progress:** Showcase the evolution of your project from week to week.
- **Decision Justification:** Explain the rationale behind specific design choices.
- **Visual Prototype Demo:** Walk the audience through your interactive prototype.
- **Reflect:** Share insights on aspects you might have approached differently.
- **Note:** Failing to present results in an automatic zero for Part 6.

## Submission Procedure

Rather than a traditional file submission, utilize Figma's sharing feature to showcase your work. Within the comment section of your submission, ensure the inclusion of:

- The Figma project link.
- The chosen theme for your application.
- A list of all group members.
- PDF version of your presentation

Given that your professor received an invitation during Part 1, a re-invitation is unnecessary.

**Submission Deadlines:**
