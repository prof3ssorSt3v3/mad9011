# Part 5: Presentations

## Introduction

For the culmination of your efforts in parts 1 through 4, each group will present their comprehensive project work. This is an opportunity to showcase your development process, decision-making, and the final visual prototype.

**Presentation Duration:** Maximum of 10 minutes per group.  
**Technical Preparation:** Ensure compatibility with HDMI input for the presentation. A USBC to HDMI adapter will be available; however, bring any additional adapters necessary for your device.

### Presentation Requirements

To successfully complete this phase, your group must:

- **Engage in the Presentation:** Failure to present will result in an automatic score of 0 for Part 6.
- **Highlight Progress:** Showcase your project's evolution from the initial concept to the final design.
- **Rationalize Design Choices:** Discuss the rationale behind key decisions throughout the design process.
- **Demonstrate the Visual Prototype:** Provide a live demo of your interactive prototype within Figma.
- **Reflect:** Share insights on what aspects of the project you would approach differently in retrospect.

### Prototype Demo

- Transition from your slide presentation to a live demo of your Figma prototype. Craft a narrative that smoothly connects the transitions between screens for a cohesive story.
