## Installing Adobe Creative Cloud

### Step 1: Request a license for Adobe Creative Cloud

To request a license for Adobe Creative Cloud, send an email to ITS at [5555@algonquincollege.com](mailto:5555@algonquincollege.com) or call the ITS Service Desk at ext. 5555.

We ask that you provide the following information:

1. First and last name
2. Student number
3. Algonquin College email address
4. Which program you are enrolled in

Your request will take up to **two (2) business days** for the license to be assigned to you, so make sure to do this right away to avoid not having access to the software during class.

Once the request is processed, you will receive an email notification from Adobe to your college email.

### Step 2: Creating Your Adobe ID or Sign-in to an Existing Account

Open the email you received from Adobe and click “Get Started”. You will be redirected to the Adobe website.

If you do not have an Adobe account:

1. Click Create an Adobe ID
2. Fill in the required information. **Note: Use your Algonquin College email address for your Adobe ID**
3. Read and accept the terms
4. If prompted, log in to your newly created account

If you do have an Adobe account, log into it now.

### Step 3: Installing the Desktop Application & Software

1. Visit the Creative Cloud Download webpage
2. The Creative Cloud installer should automatically prompt to download, or download automatically
3. Run/open the Creative Cloud installer and follow the prompts
4. Once installed, the program should open.
   If it doesn’t, look for the Creative Cloud icon in your taskbar and double click it to open
5. Log into your Adobe account if prompted
6. Navigate to the All Apps tab in the application
7. Click Install on any programs you wish to install on your computer

You can install the Creative Cloud Application on as many computers as you wish, but can only run Adobe software concurrently on **two computers at a time**.
