# Week 4 - Color and Effects

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. **Understand Color Modes**: Grasp the different color modes (RGB, CMYK, HSB, Grayscale) and how to apply them to various design contexts.
2. **Use Illustrator's Color Tools**: Master the Color Picker, Swatches, and Gradient tool in Adobe Illustrator for precise color application.
3. **Apply Effects**: Learn to use drop shadows, inner/outer glows, and feathering to enhance the depth and visual appeal of your designs.
4. **UI Design Color**: Utilize color effectively in UI design, understanding color schemes and how color affects user interaction.

## 1. Colour Modes

Color modes are crucial for achieving the correct visual output, whether on digital screens or in print. This section introduces the types of color modes, their uses, and how to switch between them in Illustrator.

### 1.1 Colour Modes: Types and Uses

Understanding color modes is essential for ensuring your designs look the way you intend across digital and print formats. Common color modes include:

- **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Ideal for digital screens.
- **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)**: Best for print media.
- **HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness)**: User-friendly for color selection based on human perception.
- **Greyscale**: Used for monochromatic designs.

**Pro Tip**: Always choose the appropriate color mode based on your design's final output—digital or print.

### 1.2 Changing Colour Modes

To switch between color modes in Illustrator:

### 1.3 Basic Color Theory

Color theory today is primarily based on Isaac Newton's colour wheel, which he established in 1666. The main colour wheel illustrates three colour categories: primary colours, secondary colours, and tertiary colours.

**Primary colors** are those that cannot be produced by mixing two or more other colors. Red, blue, and yellow are the main colors.

The **secondary colors** are orange, purple, and green, which may be created by mixing any two of the three basic colors.

**Tertiary colors** are created when you combine a main and a secondary color. Magenta, vermillion, violet, teal, amber, and chartreuse are the tertiary hues.

## 2. Using Colours in Illustrator

In Illustrator, color is applied through several tools that allow precision and flexibility. This section covers the Color Picker, Swatches, and Gradient tools.

### 2.1 Colour Picker

The **Color Picker** allows for precise color selection. You can:

- Manually input values for RGB, CMYK, or HSB.
- Select colors from a spectrum or use the eyedropper to pick colors from your design.

### 2.2 Colour Swatches

**Swatches** in Illustrator allow you to save custom colors for easy access later. To create a new swatch:

1. Select a color in the Color Picker.
2. Open the **Swatches panel**.
3. Click on the new swatch icon at the bottom to save the color for future use.

You can also explore Illustrator’s pre-made color libraries for quick access to popular palettes.

### 2.3 Gradient Tool

The **Gradient Tool** in Illustrator allows you to create smooth color transitions. There are two primary types of gradients:

- **Linear Gradient**: Transitions colors along a straight line.
- **Radial Gradient**: Transitions colors in a circular pattern from a central point.

**How to create a gradient:**

1. Select an object and open the Gradient panel.
2. Choose between **Linear** or **Radial**.
3. Adjust the color stops by dragging the sliders in the Gradient panel.
4. Customize the angle, opacity, and position of the gradient for fine control.

## 3. Effects

Effects like drop shadows, glows, and feathering help enhance the visual impact of your designs by adding depth and texture.

### 3.1 Dropshadow

Drop shadows add depth to your designs by creating a shadow effect behind an object, making it appear as if it is raised above the background.

    { label: 'Step 2', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/dropshadow/2.png' },
    { label: 'Step 3', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/dropshadow/3.png' },
    { label: 'Result', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/dropshadow/4.png' },
  ]"
/>

### 3.2 Inner or Outer Glow

Inner or Outer Glow creates a soft halo around an object, which can be used to highlight elements or create a specific mood.

<Slideshow
  :key="'Inner Glow'"
  :images="[
    { label: 'Step 1', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/innerGlow/1.png' },
    { label: 'Step 2', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/innerGlow/2.png' },
    { label: 'Step 3', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/innerGlow/3.png' },
    { label: 'Result', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/innerGlow/4.png' },
  ]"
/>

### 3.3 Feather

Feathering softens the edges of an object, creating a gradual transition between the object and the background.

<Slideshow
  :key="'Feather'"
  :images="[
    { label: 'Step 1', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/feather/1.png' },
    { label: 'Step 2', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/feather/2.png' },
    { label: 'Step 3', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/feather/3.png' },
    { label: 'Result', src: '/f2024/moduleImages/week4/feather/4.png' },
  ]"
/>

## 4. Utilizing Colors in UI Design

Color is crucial in UI design—it affects usability, readability, and the overall mood of the interface. Learn how to create harmonious color schemes that enhance user experience.
