## 1. Colour Modes

Color modes are crucial for achieving the correct visual output, whether on digital screens or in print. This section introduces the types of color modes, their uses, and how to switch between them in Illustrator.

### 1.1 Colour Modes: Types and Uses

Understanding color modes is essential for ensuring your designs look the way you intend across digital and print formats. Common color modes include:

- **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Ideal for digital screens.
- **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)**: Best for print media.
- **HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness)**: User-friendly for color selection based on human perception.
- **Greyscale**: Used for monochromatic designs.

**Pro Tip**: Always choose the appropriate color mode based on your design's final output—digital or print.

### 1.2 Changing Colour Modes

To switch between color modes in Illustrator:

1. For the whole document: `File > Document Color Mode`, then select RGB or CMYK.
2. For individual elements: Select the object, open the Color panel, click the menu icon, and choose either RGB or CMYK.

### 1.3 Basic Color Theory

Explain fundamental color theory concepts such as the color wheel, primary and secondary colors, and the 60-30-10 rule for creating balanced color schemes in UI design.

## 2. Using Colours in Illustrator

In Illustrator, color is applied through several tools that allow precision and flexibility. This section covers the Color Picker, Swatches, and Gradient tools.

### 2.1 Colour Picker

The Color Picker allows for precise color selection. You can manually input values for RGB, CMYK, or HSB, or choose from a color spectrum.

### 2.2 Colour Swatches

Use swatches to save and reuse custom colors in your design. Explore Illustrator’s pre-made color libraries for quick access to popular color schemes.

### 2.3 Gradient Tool

Master the Gradient tool to create smooth transitions between colors. You can create linear or radial gradients, adjust color stops, and save custom gradients for future use.

## 3. Effects

Effects like drop shadows, glows, and feathering help enhance the visual impact of your designs by adding depth and texture.

### 3.1 Dropshadow

Drop shadows add depth by simulating a shadow cast behind an object.

- Go to `Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow`.
- Adjust the opacity, blur, and angle to control the shadow's appearance.

### 3.2 Inner or Outer Glow

Use glows to create a halo effect around an object.

- **Inner Glow**: Adds a glow inside the object's edges.
- **Outer Glow**: Radiates outward from the object.

### 3.3 Feather

Feathering softens the edges of an object, blending it with the background.

- Go to `Effect > Stylize > Feather` and adjust the radius to control the softness.

## 4. Typography in Illustrator

Typography is crucial in communicating messages visually. This section delves into typography tools in Illustrator and how to manage text styles effectively.

### 4.1 Typography Basics

Typography isn't just about words—it's about how those words look. Learn the difference between typefaces and fonts, and understand key concepts like serif vs. sans-serif, hierarchy, and readability.

### 4.2 Working with Type in Illustrator

Illustrator’s Type tool allows for flexible text manipulation. You can create **Point Type** (click-and-type) or **Area Type** (type inside a defined shape).

### 4.3 Character and Paragraph Panels

**Character Panel**: Control font size, leading, kerning, tracking, and baseline shift to customize text appearance.

**Paragraph Panel**: Manage text alignment, indentation, and spacing between paragraphs. Perfect for creating clean, readable layouts.

## 6. UI Button Design Fundamentals

UI buttons are central to creating an intuitive user interface. This section explores key aspects of button design.

### 6.1 Sizes

Ensure your buttons are large enough to be tapped or clicked easily. For mobile, aim for 44px minimum.

### 6.2 Colour

Use color to signal importance (e.g., primary actions in bright, eye-catching colors). Ensure contrast for readability.

### 6.3 States

Buttons should have distinct visual states:

- **Normal**: Default appearance.
- **Hover**: Indicates interactivity.
- **Active**: Shows the button is being clicked.
- **Disabled**: Unavailable for interaction.

### 6.4 Typography

Use clear, readable fonts for button labels. Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the button background for accessibility.
