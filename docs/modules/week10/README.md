# Week 10 - Introduction to SVG

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. SVG images are defined in XML text files. In this section, we are going to learn how to generate good SVG code using Illustrator and preparing it to be animated and used on the web as well as how to write our own SVG code from scratch. 

[SVG Reference](./svg.md)

## From AI to SVG

Using Illustrator to design graphics and then export them in SVG format allows us to use that code directly on the web and animate it using CSS. The cleaner and more organized our `Ai` file is, the easier it will be to manipulate the `SVG` code later on. Follow the first 2 videos on LinkedIn Learning to:

- Prepare an SVG for animation
- Export SVG from Illustrator

## SVGs are code
SVGs are purely vector graphics written in XML markup language. You can use a pure code editor to create an SVG. Let's follow along this series of video tutorial and write SVG markup with VSCode. 

### Writing SVG code

In this video you will learn to write SVG code from scratch and integrate it into an HTML document.
Read SVG reference of [Writing SVG code](./svg.md#writing-svg) for the syntax and code for basic shapes.

## TODO

::: tip TODO Before next week

- If you have not read all these notes and watched the videos from this week, do that first.
- Finish reading the notes for week 9 and watch all the videos in the notes for week 10.
