## Introduction

In this lesson, we will harness our Adobe XD knowledge by using Xd productivity tools, UI Kits, and plugins. We will learn the common mobile user interface elements with ease and get an introduction to the industry design standards and guidelines: Human Interface Guidelines (AppleOS) and Material Design (Android).

## Xd Productivity Tools

Let's follow this video to practice using some popular Xd features: Object Flip, Search Layers, and Linked Symbols (now components).

## Xd Ui Kits

UI Kits content contains common buttons, form elements, headers, icons, and other UI elements. Follow this XD tutorial to learn how to get UI kits and use the Kit content in your own designs.

Note: We will explorer UI Kits for [Apple iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) and [Material Design]("https://material.io/resources) in class to understand the platform standards together. Download [Apple iOS fonts & symbols](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) and [Roboto fonts for Android devices](https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html#system-fonts)

Let's start our design with UI kits. We will follow this video to get the Wireframes UI Kits and use the content in our own XD file.
