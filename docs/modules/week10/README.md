### Nested auto Layout

Auto-layout frames can be nested, combining horizontal and vertical layout properties to compelling interface design.

- Select the objects, click shift+A again, the auto-layout frame is now a child frame inside a parent frame.

You can choose vertical or horizontal distribution and white space on the right-hand properties menu. To prevent text frames from growing in one direction, make sure you choose fixed with or height.

### Layer Management: Keeping Your Designs Organized

Effective layer management is crucial for maintaining organized and easily navigable design files in Figma. When you have multiple elements, groups, and frames in your project, a well-structured layer hierarchy can save you time and make collaboration smoother.

#### Tips for Structuring Your Layers:

1. **Naming Conventions**: Give each layer a clear and descriptive name. This practice helps you and your collaborators quickly identify the purpose of each layer. For example, use names like "Header," "Button," or "Background."

2. **Grouping**: Group related elements together. For instance, if you have a navigation menu, group its items and layers within a dedicated folder. To group elements, select them and press `Ctrl + G` (Windows) or `Cmd + G` (Mac), or use the right-click context menu.

3. **Hierarchical Ordering**: Arrange layers hierarchically. Place the most important or overarching elements at the top-level layers and their related sub-elements within groups or frames. This hierarchy makes it easier to navigate complex designs.

4. **Use Frames**: Utilize frames as containers for groups of elements. Frames help you define the boundaries of specific design sections, making it simple to manipulate and move related content as a single unit.

5. **Color-Coding**: Assign colors to layers or groups based on their purpose or type. For example, use one color for navigation elements and another for content sections. This visual differentiation enhances clarity.

6. **Lock and Hide Layers**: When working on a specific part of your design, consider locking or hiding unrelated layers temporarily. This minimizes accidental changes to elements you're not currently focusing on.

7. **Reordering Layers**: Easily reorder layers by dragging and dropping them within the layers panel. Reordering is handy when you need to adjust the stacking order of elements within a frame.

8. **Search and Filter**: Figma's layers panel includes a search bar that allows you to quickly locate specific layers, even in complex designs. Utilize this feature when you're looking for a particular element.

9. **Manage Variants**: If you have design variations, like different button states or component versions, use Figma's variant feature to organize and manage them efficiently. This keeps your designs clean and well-structured.

By implementing these tips and best practices for layer management, you'll keep your Figma projects tidy and easy to navigate. This not only improves your productivity but also enhances collaboration when working with team members or stakeholders.
