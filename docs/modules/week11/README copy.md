![Design System Banner](./design-system-banner.png)

**What is a design system?** A design system is a collection of reusable functional elements–components and patterns–guided by clear standards that product teams use to create a consistent experience across a range of products. Design systems act as a single source of truth for an entire organization by using a singular design language to guide the development of products.

Design systems should be flexible and responsive to any changes in the field of design, such as new visual design trends or the rising importance of different types of emerging technology.

### What Are the Elements of a Design System?

A design system consists of both tangible and intangible elements. Components, patterns, and style guides are tangible elements.

- **Components** are functional elements of a user interface – buttons, input fields, text labels, etc.
- **Patterns** are individual functional elements that all serve the same purpose organized into groups–sign-in forms, menus, etc.
- A **style guide** is a set of visual design decisions such as which colors, typography, iconography to use, as well as guidelines for using decorative elements such as whitespace and shadows.

Guidelines, brand values, and design mindset, on the other hand, are intangible elements:

- **Guidelines** are sets of rules that allow a team to design consistent and coherent experiences made up of components, patterns, and visual styles.
- **Brand values**, which naturally include a brand legend and brand mission, are a set of guiding principles that shape every aspect of your design.
- A **design mindset** is your philosophy of design that aligns a team around a clear set of goals.

Both tangible and intangible elements work together to direct product teams and help them make meaningful design decisions.

### What Are the Qualities of a Well-Functioning Design System?

Design systems differ based on an organization’s need, but all well-functioning design systems share similar characteristics:

- **Easily adopted:** Well-functioning design systems fit easily into the existing culture of your team, becoming a natural part of the design process.
- **Consistent:** All components of the design system should consistently and naturally work together.
- **Flexible:** Consistency is important, but well-functioning design systems leave room for team members to contribute in new ways.
- **Documented:** Documentation is one of the most important components of a well-functioning design system. Documentation should be detailed and regularly updated.
- **Reusable:** Design systems should be able to be reused and repurposed in a variety of situations.

## Effective Typography in Figma

![Typography Banner](./typography-banner.png)

Typography is a fundamental aspect of design. It involves the selection and arrangement of fonts, sizes, spacing, and other text-related elements. Effective typography can greatly impact the readability, aesthetics, and overall user experience of your design. In Figma, achieving effective typography aligns with principles outlined in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Google's Material Design, ensuring that your design not only looks good but also functions well across various platforms.

### Key Aspects of Effective Typography:

1. **Font Selection**: When selecting fonts in Figma, consider their alignment with your design's purpose and the tone you want to convey. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines suggest using system fonts such as San Francisco for Apple devices and Roboto for Android. These system fonts are designed for optimal legibility and consistency within their respective ecosystems. However, you can also explore other web fonts available in Figma to suit your design's unique needs while maintaining brand consistency.

2. **Font Sizing**: Determining appropriate font sizes is crucial for creating a consistent and user-friendly design. Apple's guidelines emphasize text legibility and readability, recommending specific text sizes for various purposes, including body text, headings, and subheadings. In Material Design, text sizing follows a similar hierarchy, with guidelines for text at different levels of importance. Figma provides text style management to ensure you maintain consistency in text hierarchy. This feature allows you to create and apply predefined text styles throughout your design, ensuring a uniform look and feel.

3. **Spacing and Line Height**: Paying attention to spacing between lines (line height) and characters (kerning) is essential to ensure text is easy to read and aesthetically pleasing. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines recommend a default line height for text, but you can adjust it according to your design needs. Material Design also offers guidelines for text line height, and Figma provides tools to adjust line height and letter spacing, allowing you to fine-tune text elements for readability and aesthetics.

4. **Hierarchy and Emphasis**: Both Apple and Google stress the importance of using typography to create visual hierarchy within your design. This involves using variations in font size, weight, and style to highlight important information and guide users through your interface. Figma's text style features allow you to define and apply different text styles for various purposes, such as emphasizing headings or distinguishing between primary and secondary text. This ensures a clear and consistent hierarchy in your design, aligning with the principles of both design systems.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensuring that text is easily readable and accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, is a fundamental consideration in both Apple's and Google's design guidelines. Apple's guidelines provide extensive recommendations for text legibility and contrast, while Material Design includes accessibility guidelines for text and color choices. In Figma, you can use design tools to check color contrast and provide alternatives for users with visual impairments, ensuring that your design meets accessibility standards and is inclusive.
