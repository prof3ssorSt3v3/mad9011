# Week 11 - SVG Animation 

## Applying CSS animations to SVG elements

SVG can have lots of effects inside it, including hovers, transitions, and animations, etc. As soon as we put our SVG into our HTML document we can apply all the effects in our CSS file. In this section, we are going to apply what we learned last week so far to animate SVGs using CSS.

## Bitwise Operators

JavaScript has a number of operators that allow us to work with data directly at the binary level. We can actually manipulate the ones and zeros that make up the bits in every value.

## The Movie DataBase (TMDB)

The Movie DataBase (TMDB) is similar to IMDB in the information that it holds. It is an API that provides information about movies and TV shows.

## City of Ottawa Open Data

Many cities around the world are starting to provide information about the City and its infrastructure to the public as `Open Data`. This is data available free of charge to the general public which most people believe should be public domain information.

Ottawa, [Calgary](https://data.calgary.ca/), [Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/), [Vancouver](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx) and [Edmonton](https://data.edmonton.ca/) all provide Open data.

## CURL - client url

ClientURL (CURL) is a command line tool that lets you make HTTP requests from the command line. It comes preinstalled on MacOS but can be installed on any OS. It can be very useful for testing APIs and avoiding CORS issues when planning your fetch code.

## Async - Await

As part of ES6, there were two new keywords `async` and `await` that allowed us to tell JavaScript that we were calling a method, which we expected to be an asychronous one, and have our function wait for the response in a synchronous way. Effectively it wraps the command inside a `Promise`.

[Learn more about async and await](./async.md)

## Iterable and Enumerable

Some objects are iterable and others are enumerable, and some are both. Understanding the difference between the two can help you write your code more effectively and without unexpected errors.

[Learn more about Iterable and Enumerable](./iter.md)

## Content Security Policy

There is a `meta` tag that you should add to all your webpages. This Content-Security-Policy tag will help you to protect your users from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

You should add this to ALL your webpages, web apps, and hybrid apps.
