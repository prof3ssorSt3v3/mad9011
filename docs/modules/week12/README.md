Efficiently managing design assets and components is fundamental to maintaining a well-structured and organized design system. In this section, you'll learn how to manage your design assets and components effectively. We'll cover:

- **Asset Libraries**: How to create and manage libraries for assets like icons, images, and UI elements. This ensures consistency across your design projects and enables easy updates.

- **Version Control**: Using Figma's version history and branching features to maintain a version control system for your design files. This aids collaboration and helps you track changes and iterations.

- **Asset Naming Conventions**: The importance of consistent naming conventions for design assets. We'll provide best practices for naming your assets to simplify organization and retrieval.
