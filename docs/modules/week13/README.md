## Introduction

Finally, welcome to Adobe XD (Xd), a vector-based user experience design tool for mobile and web apps. Xd supports rapid wireframing and click-through prototyping.

UI/UX designers use Adobe XD to seamlessly iterate and share interactive visual prototypes with team members and reviewers across devices and platforms.

### Xd Workspace

We will get familiar with the workspace and the interface by exploring the in-app resources to learn how to use Adobe XD, or to get a head start on your designs. Learn their respective tools by navigating the Design and Prototype modes.

[Workspace basics](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/xd/help/workspace-basics.html) is a quick reference for Adobe XD user interface.

#### Work with drawing and text tools

We can quickly create graphics and texts using the shape tools, Pen tool, and text tools in Adobe XD. Check out the [Work with drawing and text tools article](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/xd/help/drawing-text-tools.html) for a quick reference.

## Xd Workflow: Design > Prototype > Share

Design, prototype, and share with Adobe XD article provides a quick reference in Adobe XD User Guide.

Follow the Xd tutorials below to obtain a hands-on mobile app prototyping experience. Xd supports SVG and bitmap files without any loss of fidelity. It integrates with Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects. You can also use plugins to automate repeat operations or parts of designer workflows that are tedious, complex, or repetitive.

Before starting the workflow of: Design, Prototype, Share, we will Download the XD kits.

### Design

In **design** step, we will learn the basics for designing splash screens, importing images, and working with Repeat Grid.

Note: Do you notice that you can click on the artboard name to select/move the artboard and double-click to edit the name?

### Prototype

In **prototype** step, we will turn our designs into interactive visual mockups. We will wire artboards together, switch back and forth between design and prototype mode and preview our UI experience.

Share designs and prototypes is a user guide that contains the current Xd UI features and screenshots.

### Share

In **preview &amp; share** step, we will learn to preview our interactive prototype on a mobile device and share prototype and design specs for feedback with other designers, developers and even for usability testing.

## Collaboration features in Adobe XD

Creative Cloud plan includes different types of cloud storage features for different uses and benefits: cloud documents, libraries, and Creative Cloud files (synced files).

Cloud documents in Adobe XD article is a comprehensive guide for Adobe XD Cloud sharing and collaboration.

### Using Xd Cloud Documents

Xd Cloud Documents let us auto-save files, safely keep everything in one place, make fast and easy sharing, and work and live collaborate with others anywhere by using the document versioning control.

#### Using Cloud Document Files

Let's practice using cloud document files. If you notice minor UI differences in the video, you can find your way around in the reference of Workspace basics page.
