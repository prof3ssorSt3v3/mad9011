# Week 13 - Xd Productivity tools, resources and layout best practices

In this lesson, we will harness our Adobe XD knowledge by using XD productivity tools, UI Kits, and plugins. We will learn the common mobile user interface elements with ease and get an introduction to the industry design standards and guidelines: Human Interface Guidelines (Mac), Material Design (Android), and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) design guidance. 


## Xd Productivity Tools

Let's follow these video to practice using some common productivity tools. First, we will learn `Object Flip`, `Search Layers`, `Linked Symbols (now components)` features.

### COMPONENTS

`Compenents` are previousely called *Symbols*. This tutorial shows us how to effectively utilise the new `Master Components`, and `Component Overrides` features.

We will practice further with the following tutorials. Note: Download respective tutorial files on YouTube.

**Creating components**

Let's create components by converting a group of objects to a component, and creating multiple instances on the design canvas.

**Updating master components**

Next, we will customize the multiple instances of a component we create and then better understand their parent/child relationship.

**Nesting components**

To make the components easy to main, we will nest components within one another to build out a molecular design structure.

**Component Hover states & Micro-Interactions**

Check this video to learn how component states allows you to save elements for future use and create additional versions of your buttons, toggles, fields, and more.

## XD Resources

[**Adobe XD resources**](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd/resources.html) site provides free tools to optimize our workflow and speed up the process: UI kits, icon sets, plugins, app integrations, and more. 



### XD UI KITS
UI Kits content contains common buttons, form elements, headers, icons, and other UI elements.Follow this XD tutorial to learn how to get UI kits and use the Kit content in your own designs

###  Plugin Manager

Here is an updated version of the code that we used in class to create our first SPA. This version includes the ability to right-click and load a link in a new tab.

[Simple-SPA repo](https://github.com/prof3ssorSt3v3/simple-spa-demo)

You can feel free to use any of this code as a starting point or reference for your first Movie SPA Project.

## Cordova Splashscreens

Splashscreen images for your Cordova app need to be available in both Portrait and Landscape orientations and at a variety of sizes and resolutions.

You should use Photoshop to create the images and then you will need to use the `config.xml` to link to the images.

[Learn more about Splashscreens in Cordova](./splash.md)

## Cordova Launcher Icons

Just like the splashscreen images, the launcher icons need to be created at different sizes for different resolutions. Then you will put the links inside the `config.xml` file.

[Learn more about Launcher Icons in Cordova](./launcher.md)

## Cordova Building Apps

If you need to re-compile your project and include the latest splashscreen or launcher icons then we can use the `cordova build` command.

[Learn more about Building Apps in Cordova](./build.md)

## Cordova Emulating Apps

To launch your app in an emulator or simulator you can use the `cordova emulate` command.

[Learn more about Emulating Apps in Cordova](./emulate.md)

## Cordova Running apps

Cordova also has a `cordova run` command which will compile your project, install it on an attached device, and launch the app on the device.
