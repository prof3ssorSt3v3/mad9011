# Week 13 - Mobile UI Layout

## Xd Productivity tools, resources and layout best practices

In this lesson, we will harness our Adobe XD knowledge by using Xd productivity tools, UI Kits, and plugins. We will learn the common mobile user interface elements with ease and get an introduction to the industry design standards and guidelines: Human Interface Guidelines (AppleOS), Material Design (Android), and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) design guidance 


## Xd Productivity Tools

Let's follow this video to practice using some popular Xd features: `Object Flip`, `Search Layers`, and `Linked Symbols (now components)`

### XD INTERACTIONS 

Let's watch this set of short videos to practice popular prototype interacation design in Adobe XD. We will build prototype with screen animation, transitions, drag gesture, componenet overlay, and voice control.

## XD Resources (Under "Features" Tab)

[*Adobe XD resources*, now under Features tab](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/features/ui-kits.html) provides resources we can use to optimize our workflow and speed up the design process. They include `UI kits`, `icon sets`, `plugins`, `app integrations`, and more.

### XD UI KITS

UI Kits content contains common buttons, form elements, headers, icons, and other UI elements. Follow this XD tutorial to learn how to get UI kits and use the Kit content in your own designs. 

Note: We will explorer UI Kits for [**Apple iOS**](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) and [**Material Design**](https://material.io/resources) in class to understand the platform standards together. Download [Apple iOS fonts & symbols](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) and [Roboto fonts for Android devices](https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html#system-fonts)

**Let's start our design with UI kits.** We will follow this video to get the *Wireframes UI Kits* and use the content in our own XD file.
