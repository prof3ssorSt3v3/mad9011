# Week 3 - Time to color

## Color theory and tools

Color theory is simpler than you think. We are going to learn a little bit about why some colors look good together and some don't,  how to choose the right ones, and the tools on Adobe Illustrator to manipulate and color shapes.


### DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS   

The fundamentals of design are going to play a very important role in your career and you will learn more about them later on, but for now take a look at this nice video to get an introduction.

### COLOUR FUNDAMENTALS 

Being proficient at picking the right colors is very important but not an easy task and there is a lot of theory behind it, but if you follow some simple rules you are likely to make the right decision.

There are some great resources out there to help you, here is a great example; this site allows you to generate a color palette guaranteed to look good and shows you some examples of how to use each color as well with common elements on the web: **[Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/)**


## Color swatches in adobe illustrator

Strings are one of the Primitive values that we have in JavaScript. However, because there are so many things that we tend to do to manipulate Strings, there is also a String Object.

JavaScript actually creates this String Object for you automatically, behind the scenes, any time you have a variable and you assign the variable a String primitive value.

## for Loops

Imagine that you had an Array with 15,000 names inside it. Now imagine that you need to console.log all 15,000 names in the Array.

Want to write console.log 15,000 times?

No? [Let's talk about Loops](./for.md)

## Compound If Statements

When writing an `if` statement sometimes you want to check the value of two variables at the same time and then do something if both meet your conditions or something if either meets your conditions.

The logical **AND** and **OR** operators are how we accomplish this.
