# Week 3 - Arrays, Strings, Loops

## Basic Objects

While everything that you work with in JavaScript, except primitives, is an object, there is a basic Object that provides a template for all Objects.

We will be using this basic Object to create lots of custom objects of our own.

## Arrays

Arrays are lists. You want to work with a list of values? Then you likely need an Array. Arrays will be one of the core Objects that you work with continually in Javascript.

## String Objects

Strings are one of the Primitive values that we have in JavaScript. However, because there are so many things that we tend to do to manipulate Strings, there is also a String Object.

JavaScript actually creates this String Object for you automatically, behind the scenes, any time you have a variable and you assign the variable a String primitive value.

## for Loops

Imagine that you had an Array with 15,000 names inside it. Now imagine that you need to console.log all 15,000 names in the Array.

Want to write console.log 15,000 times?

No? [Let's talk about Loops](./for.md)

## Compound If Statements

When writing an `if` statement sometimes you want to check the value of two variables at the same time and then do something if both meet your conditions or something if either meets your conditions.

The logical **AND** and **OR** operators are how we accomplish this.
