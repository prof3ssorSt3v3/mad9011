# Week 4 - Arrays, Dates, Math, Errors

## Array Loops

Once you understand what arrays are and how you can add and remove values from an Array, then you need to know how to loop over the values.

We already discussed the `for...loop` method last week, and that works fine but there are actually built-in methods designed to loop over Arrays for specific purposes.

[forEach and map](./foreach.md)

## Array Methods

There are A LOT of methods that belong to Array Objects.

Come back to [this Array tutorial page](./methods.md) for a full reference to the abilities of Arrays.

## Date Objects

JavaScript has a built-in `Date` object which is used to store a reference to a specific moment in time.

[Learn about the Date Object](./date.md)

## Math and Number Objects

JavaScript has a built-in Object called `Math`. This Object contains all the methods for dealing with things like rounding numbers off, trigonometry, and random number generation.

Number is one of our Primitive types, but just like String, it also has an Object hiding behind the scenes which gives use some properties and methods for manipulating the numeric values.

[Learn the basics about the Math and Number Objects](./math.md)

## Error Objects

An exception is a condition that interrupts normal code execution.

We will use the terms Errors and Exceptions interchangeably.

In JavaScript Errors can occur for a variety of reasons. There are ways that we can handle those without letting our program crash.

## Other Loop Types

In addition to the basic `for...loop` and the Array `forEach` method, there are other types of loops too. While `for` and `forEach` will fit most cases, it is good to be aware of the alternatives too.

- If you have not read all these notes and watched the videos from this week, do that first.
- Finish reading the notes for week 4 and watch all the videos in the notes for week 5.
