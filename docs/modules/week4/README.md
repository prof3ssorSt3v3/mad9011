# Week 4 - Time to draw 

## Drawing tools

Let's get drawing!

In this section, we are going to learn how to draw shapes and edit them using different tools.

First, we will learn about the _pen_ tool, how to use it and what is made of, then we will cover the _pencil_ and _brushes_ tools and learn how to edit shapes using the _blend_ and _pathfinder_ tools. Finally, we are going to see how the _clipping mask_ is used and how it makes our lives easier.

## Array Methods

There are A LOT of methods that belong to Array Objects.

Come back to [this Array tutorial page](./methods.md) for a full reference to the abilities of Arrays.

## Date Objects

JavaScript has a built-in `Date` object which is used to store a reference to a specific moment in time.

[Learn about the Date Object](./date.md)

## Math and Number Objects

JavaScript has a built-in Object called `Math`. This Object contains all the methods for dealing with things like rounding numbers off, trigonometry, and random number generation.

Number is one of our Primitive types, but just like String, it also has an Object hiding behind the scenes which gives use some properties and methods for manipulating the numeric values.

[Learn the basics about the Math and Number Objects](./math.md)

## Error Objects

An exception is a condition that interrupts normal code execution.

We will use the terms Errors and Exceptions interchangeably.

In JavaScript Errors can occur for a variety of reasons. There are ways that we can handle those without letting our program crash.

## Other Loop Types

In addition to the basic `for...loop` and the Array `forEach` method, there are other types of loops too. While `for` and `forEach` will fit most cases, it is good to be aware of the alternatives too.
