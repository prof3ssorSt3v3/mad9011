# Week 5 - Typography & Depth

## Typography, special effects, perspective grid, flare tool and exporting

In this module, you will be learning how to add text to your designs, apply `effects` to that text and other objects, use the `perspective grid` to give a three-dimensional effect to the artboard contents and use the `flare` tool to replicate the effect of light.

Once your design is complete, you are going to need to `export` it to be able to use it for the online and print projects. Here you will learn how to export to different types of files.

**Let's get familiar with the BASIC OF TYPOGRAPHY.**

### FLARE TOOL

The flare tool is an effect you can add to your design and manipulate to mimic the effect of light.

You can find the `Flare tool` in the `Shape tools` group in the **Advanced toolbar.**
