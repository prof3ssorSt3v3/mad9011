# Week 6 - Introduction to Photoshop

## Howdy! Adobe Photoshop

Welcome to the Photoshop section of this course, which will focus on mobile features, including designing User Interface(UI), creating/composing graphics and the necessary colour basics.  Let's begin with the how's and why's of setting up documents.


## Basic features & tools

We will use Adobe Photoshop to create raster-based (bitmap) graphics, let's start by using these Photoshop basic features of open or create a new document, save a document, work area, zoom in/out, and undo mistakes. Take a look at this series of short tutorials to [**Get to know Photoshop.** ](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/ps-basics-fundamentals.html)

- Open images
- Get familiar with the work area
- Learn how to zoom and pan
- Undo a command
- Save your work


### USING ARTBOARDS

Think of an artboard as **a special type of layer group**. We will learn all kinds of Photoshop layers in the next 2 weeks. Have you noticed how similar or different artboard layers are in PhotoShop than in Illustrator? 

For a quick reference, read this [artboard tutorial article.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/artboards.html)

## Loading Events

Loading events happen with every file that a browser loads. Images, Stylesheets, Scripts and HTML files will all trigger `load` events.

[How to listen for loading events](./load.md)

## Mouse and Touch Events

There are quite a few mouse and touch events.

```
click, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout, focus, blur, dblclick, contextmenu, touchstart, touchmove, touchcancel
```

## Keyboard and Form Events

The keyboard events allow youto trigger code when the user is typing. You can wait for specific keys, keyboard controls for games, and handle form validation when the values of form fields changes.

## Namespacing

Namespacing is how we protect our code against naming conflicts with other peoples scripts. Anyone who builds an HTML file, can add `<script>` tags that point to any JavaScript file which is publicly available online.

That means that your JavaScript file and the JavaScript files belonging to 10 of your friends can all be loaded and running on the same page.

With 100 lines of script in each file, there is a decent chance that two of you could have created a global variable with the same name. This means that the second one to load will overwrite the second one OR if you used `const` then an error will stop all the scripts from running.

[Solve this problem with Namespacing](./namespace.md)

## Cloning and Copying HTML

When you tell an Element that it is being Appended to a specific place on a webpage, this usually means that you are appending an Element that you just created. However, you can append elements that already exist on the page.

If you append an element that already exists, that means you will actually move the Element from its old position to the new one.

If you want to add a duplicate of the Element then you need to use the `cloneNode` method.
