# Week 6 - Introduction to Adobe Photoshop

## Howdy! 

Welcome to Adobe Photoshop, we will use Ps to create raster-based (bitmap) graphics. Our focus will be on mobile features, including designing User Interface(UI), creating/composing graphics and the necessary colour basics. Let's first get familiar with Photoshop workspace and then move to the basic features and tools.

## Basic and popular features & tools

 We will learn the how's and why's of setting up documents to open or create a new document, save a document, navigate the work area, zoom in/out, and undo mistakes.

- Open images
- Get familiar with the work area

- Undo a command
- Save your work


### USING ARTBOARDS

Think of an artboard as **a special type of layer group**. We will learn all kinds of Photoshop layers in the next few weeks. Have you noticed how similar or different artboard layers are in PhotoShop than in Illustrator? For a quick reference, read this [artboard tutorial article.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/artboards.html) To begin, follow along this video tutorial.

### CHANGE THE IMAGE SIZE

We will learn to resize, crop, and straighten an image and change the canvas size. **NOTE:** Canvas and image resize won't work when artboards are used. Resize artboards instead. Let's Begin the tutorial to [**Change the image size.**](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/image-resizing-basics.html)

- Resize an image
- Set the resolution
- Crop and straighten an image
- Expand the canvas


### MAKE SELECTIONS

A selection isolates part of an image so you can work on that area without affecting the rest of the image. Take a look at this series of short tutorials and practice [**making selections.**](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/selection-tools-basics.html)

- Learn selection basics
- Learn how to use the Quick Selection and Lasso tools
- Fine-tune a selection


### CREATE SILHOUETTES 

First, we will make and refine selections in the Selection and Masking Space to create a masking image. Let's practice along with the [Accurately select image areas tutorial.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/selection-masking-space.html)



Next, we will convert the masking image to a `Smart Object Layer` and change the `Blending Mode` of that layer to create a silhouette. To make the image more interesting, add a nice background layer. Here is a completed example. 




### CONTENT-AWARE FILL

Content-Aware Fill was designed to make removing unwanted objects or distracting elements from your photos as easy as possible. Simply by drawing a selection around an area, Photoshop can instantly replace it with new image detail from the surrounding areas. Follow along this 14-min video, we will learn the 2019 Content-aware fill workspace vs 2018 content-aware fill vs Spot Healing Brush tool
