Our focus will be on mobile features, including designing User Interface(UI), creating/composing graphics and the necessary colour basics. Let's first get familiar with Photoshop workspace and then move to the basic features and tools.

### CREATE SILHOUETTES 

First, we will make and refine selections in the Selection and Masking Space to create a masking image. Let's practice along with this [Accurately select image areas tutorial.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/selection-masking-space.html)

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/selection-masking-space.html" target=”_blank”>![Accurately select image areas](./accurateSelectMask.png)</a>

Next, we will convert the masking image to a `Smart Object Layer` and change the `Blending Mode` of that layer to create a silhouette. To make the image more interesting, add a nice background layer. Here is a completed example.

### CONTENT-AWARE FILL

Content-Aware Fill makes removing unwanted objects or distracting elements from your photos easy. Simply by drawing a selection around an area, Photoshop can instantly replace it with new image detail from the surrounding areas. Follow along this 14-min video, we will learn Content-aware fill workspace, basic content-aware fill, and `Spot Healing Brush` tool.
