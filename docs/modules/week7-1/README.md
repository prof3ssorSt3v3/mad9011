## What are SVGs?

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. SVG images are defined in XML text files. In this section, we are going to learn how to generate good SVG code using Adobe Illustrator and preparing it to be animated and used on the web as well as how to write our own SVG code from scratch.

## SVGs are code

SVGs are purely vector graphics written in XML markup language. We can use a pure code editor to create an SVG. Let's follow along this series of video tutorial and write SVG markup with VSCode.

### Writing SVG Code

In this video we will learn to write SVG code from scratch and integrate it into an HTML document. Read SVG reference of Writing SVG code for basic syntax and SVG shapes.

### SVG Attributes and CSS

There are a bunch of SVG attributes, like fill that can be written in the SVG as well as in CSS.

When exporting from tools like Adobe Illustrator we should use the SVG presentation attributes to avoid naming collisions.

For example, to change the fill of an element we could use the fill="" attribute like this:

```html
<svg width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256">
  <rect fill="#f33" x="10" y="10" width="75" height="50" />
</svg>
```

```css
.my-rect {
  fill: #f33;
}
```

Or, we could use CSS, like shown above.

The important thing to remember is that if the SVG element has an attribute (like fill="") and also the same CSS property (like fill:) then the CSS will always overwrite. The CSS property is more powerful than the SVG attribute.

<!-- These online tools let us generate code for SVG gradients, CSS gradients and edit their code.

## From AI to SVG

Using Adobe Illustrator (Ai) to design graphics and then export them in SVG format allows us to use that code directly on the web and animate it using CSS. The cleaner and more organized our Ai file is, the easier it will be to manipulate the SVG code later on. Follow this videos to exporting SVGs from Illustrator for animation.

### Cleaning generated SVG

Now we know that if we use SVGs generated by a tool like Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or Inkscape, there’s lots of extra cruft that we don’t need in the files. We can use some optimization tools to clean up the SVG. Here are the two popular online tools to use.

<!-- ## SVG Icons & Symbols

Animated SVGs are great for icons which can indicate micro-interactions and state changes and guide a user to the next action in an onboarding tour. They are commonly used to show status of loading, uploading, menu toggling, and playing/pausing a video. We will practice using SVG icons in this video tutorial.

<!-- ### SVG symbols

We will practice using SVG elements `<symbol>` and `<use>` to make SVG icon systems.

### Spritebot

Spritebot is a tool used to clean up our SVGs. It can also combine numerous SVGs into a single sprite sheet for easier use on our websites.

<!-- ## SVG Accessiblity

Lastly, we will learn the extended accessibility features of SVG and know when/how to hide embedded SVG from accessibility tools when needed.
