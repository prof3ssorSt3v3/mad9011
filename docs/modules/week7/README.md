# Week 7 - Nondestructive editing & image composite

## Make me look good!

Let's get familiar with the powerful, nondestructive editing features in Photoshop. We will composite images with text layers, shape layers, layer effects, adjustment layers, smart filter layers, smart objects, and the blending mode to make changes to an image without overwriting its original image data.

## Nondestructive Image Editing 

Because nondestructive editing doesn’t remove data from an image, the image quality doesn’t degrade when you make edits. You can perform nondestructive editing in Photoshop in several ways, read the full article in Techniques for nondestructive editing. First, we will use the type and shape tools to create layers. 

### TEXTS & SHAPES

Text and shape layers are editable in Photoshop just like they are in Illustrator. This set of video tutorials covers the basics of [adding texts and shapes layers.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/adding-text-shapes-basics.html)

- Edit text
- Create a graphic shape
- Add a built-in custom shape

## Nested Loops

It is a common thing for data structures to have Arrays inside an Array. Visually, you can think of this as a grid or table of data. There will be rows and columns.

To write loops that will traverse over the whole data structure, we can use nested loops. The outer loop looks at the rows. The inner loop looks at the columns.

## XML and JSON Validation

After you have created your XML or JSON files, you should ALWAYS validate your data.

You want to be sure that you have properly followed the standards.

Here are a couple websites that you can use to validate your data files.

[XML validation](https://www.xmlvalidation.com/)

[JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/)

## Callback Functions

In JavaScript, functions are considered to be first-class Objects. This means you can treat them like any other variable or Object. You can pass them to a function or return them from a function.

This affords us the ability to pass functions to other functions and let it decide if and when it wants to call the function being passed in.

[Learn about Callback functions](./callback.md)

## Closures

Closures are a very important concept in Javascript. They have to do with how scope works in connect with functions and variables.

To really understand the value being saved or updated in a variable you need to understand its scope. To fully understand scope you need to understand what a closure is.

[Learn about Closures](./closure.md)

## Call, Apply and Bind

We have been calling functions from the start of the semester using a set of parentheses after the name of the function.

However, there are three methods that allow us to call a function and change the context of how the function runs.

## Chrome Dev Tools

Chrome comes with an extensive set of Developer Tools, built into the browser.

[Here is the link to the official supporting guides](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

There are also excellent developer tools in MS Edge and Firefox, and to a lesser extent in Safari.
