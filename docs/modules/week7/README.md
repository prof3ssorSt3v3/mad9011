Now, let's get familiar with the powerful, nondestructive editing features in Photoshop. We will composite images with text layers, shape layers, layer effects, adjustment layers, smart filter layers, smart objects, and the blending mode to make changes to an image without overwriting its original image data.

## Nondestructive Image Editing 

[*Techniques for nondestructive editing* -](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/nondestructive-editing.html) Because nondestructive editing doesn’t remove data from an image, the image quality doesn’t degrade when you make edits. Now, we will use the type and shape tools to create layers. 

### TEXTS & SHAPES

Text and shape layers are editable in Photoshop just like they are in Illustrator. This set of video tutorials covers the basics of [adding texts and shapes layers.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/adding-text-shapes-basics.html)

- Add text
- Edit text
- Create a graphic shape
- Add a built-in custom shape


### LAYER STYLES

[*Layer effects and styles*](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/layer-effects-styles.html) cover how a layer style is one or more effects applied to a layer or layer group. They change the appearance of a layer’s contents in a non-destructive way. 

The video below walks us through how to use layer styles, the different types of layer styles, how to remove, copy, and add them.

### ADJUSTMENT LAYERS (BASIC)

[*Adjustment layer*](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/adjustment-layer.html) lets you apply colour and tonal adjustments to your image without permanently changing pixel values. 

This video explains what Photoshop adjustment layers are and the best way to work with them. Adjustment layers allow you to change the hue and situation, contrast, colour grading and the tone curve in Photoshop. You can use the adjustment layer mask to help with more refined photoshop editing techniques.

### SMART FILTERS

#### Filter Gallery 
The first set of videos will teach us to apply creative filters using the [Filter Gallery.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/applying-filters-basics.html) The edit is applied permanently to the image.

- Browse the Filter Gallery
- Blur an image with Smart Filters

Extra: Have fun with the [Liquify Filter!](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/face-aware-liquify.html)

#### Apply Smart Filters
[Apply Smart Filters](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/applying-smart-filters.html) let you add filter to a `Smart Object` layer. Smart Filters appear in the Layers panel below the Smart Object layer applied. You can adjust, remove, or hide Smart Filters, so they are nondestructive editing. 


## Callback Functions

In JavaScript, functions are considered to be first-class Objects. This means you can treat them like any other variable or Object. You can pass them to a function or return them from a function.

This affords us the ability to pass functions to other functions and let it decide if and when it wants to call the function being passed in.

[Learn about Callback functions](./callback.md)

## Closures

Closures are a very important concept in Javascript. They have to do with how scope works in connect with functions and variables.

To really understand the value being saved or updated in a variable you need to understand its scope. To fully understand scope you need to understand what a closure is.

[Learn about Closures](./closure.md)

## Call, Apply and Bind

We have been calling functions from the start of the semester using a set of parentheses after the name of the function.

However, there are three methods that allow us to call a function and change the context of how the function runs.

[Learn about call, apply, and bind](./bind.md)

## Chrome Dev Tools

Chrome comes with an extensive set of Developer Tools, built into the browser.

[Here is the link to the official supporting guides](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

There are also excellent developer tools in MS Edge and Firefox, and to a lesser extent in Safari.
