Now, let's get familiar with the powerful, nondestructive editing features in Photoshop. We will composite images with text layers, shape layers, layer effects, adjustment layers, smart filter layers, smart objects, and the blending mode to make changes to an image without overwriting its original image data.

## Nondestructive Image Editing 

[*Techniques for nondestructive editing* -](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/nondestructive-editing.html) Because nondestructive editing doesn’t remove data from an image, the image quality doesn’t degrade when you make edits. Now, we will use the type and shape tools to create layers. 

### TEXTS & SHAPES

Text and shape layers are editable in Photoshop just like they are in Illustrator. This set of video tutorials covers the basics of [adding texts and shapes layers.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/adding-text-shapes-basics.html)

- Create a graphic shape
- Add a built-in custom shape


### LAYER STYLES

[*Layer effects and styles*](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/layer-effects-styles.html) cover how a layer style is one or more effects applied to a layer or layer group. They change the appearance of a layer’s contents in a non-destructive way. 

The video below walks us through how to use layer styles, the different types of layer styles, how to remove, copy, and add them.

### ADJUSTMENT LAYERS (BASIC)

[*Adjustment layer*](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/adjustment-layer.html) lets you apply colour and tonal adjustments to your image without permanently changing pixel values. 

This video explains what Photoshop adjustment layers are and the best way to work with them. Adjustment layers allow you to change the hue and situation, contrast, colour grading and the tone curve in Photoshop. You can use the adjustment layer mask to help with more refined photoshop editing techniques.

### SMART FILTERS

The first video will teach us to apply creative filters using the [Filter Gallery.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/applying-filters-basics.html) The edit is applied permanently to the image.

- Browse the Filter Gallery
- Blur an image with Smart Filters

[Apply Smart Filters](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/applying-smart-filters.html) let you add filter to a `Smart Object` layer. Smart Filters appear in the Layers panel below the Smart Object layer applied. You can adjust, remove, or hide Smart Filters, so they are nondestructive editing. Follow along the 2nd video to [Blur an image with Smart Filters.](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/applying-filters-basics.html#blur_an_image_with_smart_filters)
