## Get ready for Week 9

### Creating a Figma Account

For you to access Figma, you must create a Figma account. Figma offers a Starter (free) plan with an education "upgrade", which will be enough for the remainder of the term. Please ensure that you make your account using your **student email**.

Make sure you select the Starter plan. If by some mistake you come to a screen that asks for payment information, something has gone wrong, and you will need to check the plan you selected.

### Installing Figma Desktop Version

Figma is different from other graphics editing tools. Mainly because it works **directly on your browser**. This means you get to access your projects and start designing from any computer or platform without having to buy multiple licenses or install software.

Consider Downloading the Desktop app [here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).
