## Prototyping

![Wireframe Example](./schematic-example.png)

Prototyping is a crucial step in the design process that involves creating interactive, testable representations of your design concepts. These prototypes can vary in fidelity, from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity interactive simulations. Prototyping is essential for several reasons:

### Why Prototype

1. **User Feedback:** Prototypes allow you to gather early feedback from users or stakeholders. This feedback can help refine your design and identify potential issues.

2. **Visualization:** Prototypes provide a visual representation of your design ideas, making it easier for others to understand and evaluate the concept.

3. **Functionality Testing:** With interactive prototypes, you can test the functionality and user flow of your design, identifying any usability problems.

4. **Validation:** Prototypes help validate design decisions and ensure that the final product aligns with user needs and expectations.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are a type of prototype that focuses on the structural layout of a design.

### Types of Wireframes

<DetailsCard imageSrc="/w2024/moduleImages/week9/lowFidelityWireframes.png" :isFirst="true">

#### Low-fidelity

Low-fidelity wireframing offers the advantage of rapid creation, making it an invaluable tool for brainstorming sessions. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the logical arrangement of content and functional elements on individual pages. In the pursuit of this objective, low-fidelity wireframes intentionally avoid the use of styling elements such as colors, images, and typography, ensuring that the wireframe's core purpose remains undistracted.

**Types of Low-fidelity Wireframes:**

- [Paper Sketches](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/)
- [Grey-Box Wireframes](https://www.arcstone.com/blog/what-is-a-wireframe-and-why-is-it-all-grey-boxes)
- Reference Zone Wireframes

</DetailsCard>

<DetailsCard imageSrc="/w2024/moduleImages/week9/midFidelityWireframes.png">

#### Mid-fidelity

Mid-fidelity wireframes are a balanced approach, offering a clearer depiction of content structure and layout compared to low-fidelity versions. While they include basic styling and might suggest interactions and user flow, they avoid intricate details. Mid-fidelity wireframes are efficient for collaboration, feedback collection, and usability testing, making them a popular choice in the design process.

**Types of Mid-fidelity Wireframes:**

- [Annotated Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/wireframe-annotations/)
- [Flow Diagram Wireframes / Wireflows](https://uxplanet.org/ux-glossary-task-flows-user-flows-flowcharts-and-some-new-ish-stuff-2321044d837d)

</DetailsCard>

<DetailsCard imageSrc="/w2024/moduleImages/week9/highFidelityWireframes.png">

#### High-fidelity

High fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes are made to look and behave as closely as possible to the finished product.

Teams typically develop high-quality prototypes when they have a clear idea of the product they intend to develop and need to test it with actual users or obtain stakeholder agreement for the final design.

**The fundamental qualities of a high fidelity prototype are as follows:**

- **Visual design:** Detailed and realistic design that looks exactly like a real app or website in terms of spacing, interface elements, and visuals.
- **Content:** Designers employ actual or related-to-real content. The majority or all of the content that will be present in the final design is present in the prototype.
- **Interactivity:** Prototypes are highly realistic in their interactions.

### Creating a Figma Account

For you to access Figma, you must create a Figma account. Figma offers a Starter (free) plan with an education "upgrade", which will be enough for the remainder of the term. Please ensure that you make your account using your **student email**.

Make sure you select the Starter plan. If by some mistake you come to a screen that asks for payment information, something has gone wrong, and you will need to check the plan you selected.

A paid Figma plan is not included in your tuition as of now. This might change if Adobe integrates Figma into its Creative Cloud.
