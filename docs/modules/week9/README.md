# Week 9 - Photo retouching & Image optimization

## Final Photoshop Learning

It's time to have fun with intuitive photo retouching and restoring tools. We will work on optimizing images for the web. User hates to wait, taking 2-3 seconds to load an image is a long time for them. Our goal is to deliver high-quality images in the right format, dimension, resolution while keeping the smallest possible size with the least loading time. Finally, we will wrap up our learning by explorering the popular 2020 Adobe Photoshop new features.

Let's combine your skills by using the content-aware technology for object removal.

## Promises

The `Fetch` API is actually built on top of another technology that became official with ES6 in 2015 - `Promises`.

Promises did for asynchronous programming, what fetch did for AJAX.


## Timers

If you want to do a task repeatedly and as quickly as possible then you use some type of loop. However, if you want to repeatedly do something with a delay between each task or you want to do something once after some delay, then you want to use the `setTimeout` or `setInterval` methods.

## Keyword `this`

There is a keyword in JavaScript `this` which can be quite confusing to understand as it's value changes depending on the circumstances of where it is used.

Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, has said that he regrets adding it to the language but did so because of pressure from his superiors to include more Object Oriented features and be more like another new popular language `Java`.

Despite all that, it can be a useful tool, once you understand how it works.

## Arrow Functions and `this`

Arrow Functions are one of the cases where the meaning of the keyword `this` changes.

[Review Arrow functions and how they differ from other functions](./arrow.md)

## JSONP

There is a variation of JSON called JSON-P which was used to circumvent some of the restrictions imposed on fetching of JSON files. While not as common as it was five years ago, you may still come across it.
