## Course Policy

The students will be learning online, guided by a curriculum with video tutorials, discussions and quizzes. They will reflect what they have learned on weekly homework and apply practical knowledge to assignments and final project. The in-class time will not be a lesson therefore each student must complete the curriculum modules themselves to move through this course. Participating in peer reviews, chats and forums will be a big part of the activities learned.

### Late Penalty

Assignments will be penalized for being late at the rate of 10% per day to a maximum of 30%. After 10 days beyond the due date, assignments will be given a grade of zero.

Students may still submit their assignments after the ten days but it will only be for the purpose of receiving feedback on their work. No grade will be given.

### Performance Requirement

In-class work progress review is part of the performance assessment. A student must pass the combined term work (marked exercises, discussions, assignments, and quizzes) and score higher than 50% in all graded assignments, project, and 2 quizzes to pass this course.

### Discussions

Under the Discussion section, you will already find some started, remember the conversation history exists as long as the course exists. Discussions will be moderated by your instructor for coherence. Please participate, ask questions, respond to some, also attach some of your better design for peer viewing and thoughts. Participation counts for 8% of the total for the course so please join in.
