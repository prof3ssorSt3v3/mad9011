# Resources

When there are resources that will be used repeatedly, or ones that are mentioned in class but that are not already in the notes, they will be added to this list.

Do **NOT** rely on W3Schools for accurate information.

Be careful about information from StackOverflow. Some is excellent but some is really out of date.

The [LearnJavaScript sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/) is a good place to ask and answer questions.
